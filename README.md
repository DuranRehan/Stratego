# ‚öîÔ∏è Stratego (C++ Console & Qt GUI Versions)

This project is a basic implementation of the classic board game **Stratego**, developed as part of my **first academic programming assignment**. It includes two versions:

- A **console-based version** for simple gameplay via terminal
- A **GUI version** built with **Qt**, providing a graphical interface

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This is an early project created to practice C++ programming and GUI development with Qt. It is quite basic and does **not reflect my current skill level**. It is kept public as a record of my learning journey.

## üéØ Game Overview

Stratego is a strategy board game where two players command armies, each piece having a rank and special movement or combat rules. The objective is to capture the opponent‚Äôs flag while protecting your own.
The game rules follow the classic model of [Stratego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratego).
The game is considered "partial information," meaning that a player does not have prior knowledge of the identity of the opponent's pieces.
__In comparison to the basic rules__:

* Continuously pursuing a piece is allowed.
* You are not required to implement the rule forcing you to attack an opponent's vulnerable piece.
* There is a debugging mode available that allows the identity of a piece previously revealed during combat to remain visible.
* The red and blue players must load their pieces from a file named red.txt and blue.txt, respectively.
